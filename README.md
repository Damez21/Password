# Password

So in this week 3 challenge i did the password generator.
Since the HTML and CSS where given, i had to create my Java Script from scracth. During this challenge I created an array of numbers, upper and lower case letters , as well as special characters.

Next i worked on the generate password function, and created a for loop to coninside with the the prompts function i also created.

Then i proceeded to create if and else statements inside of the the get prompts function, to make my java make sense.

After that i worked on the write password function since the Event Listen was provided at the start of the assignment. I created the randomizer using Math.random and the other various tools. Once i seen that my Java had ZERO red makes and mistakes, I tested my generator a bunch of times and was happy with my results.

Lastly, I Changed the Color scheme in CSS for some extra practice. Screen Shots are in images folder.
